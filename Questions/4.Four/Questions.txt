iii. Create a class which stores a sting and its length as data members. Include all the

constructors. Include a member function to join two strings and display the

concatenated string.

iv. WAP to demonstrate the order of call of constructors and destructors for a class.

v. WAP to count number of objects created from a class using concept of static data
