i. WAP to overload following operators for class distance, which stores the distance in feet

and inches.

a) Binary + to

-add two objects (D3=D1+D2)

-Add an object to an integer, where the integer should be added to the

inches value ( D2=4+D1)

b) Unary -

ii. Create a class to store an integer array. Overload insertion and extraction operator to

input and display the array elements.

iii. Create a class which a complex number. Add two objects and display the resultant object.

Overload the ++ (post and pre) operator for the class.

iv. Create a class which allocates the memory for a string through dynamic constructor.

Overload the binary + to concatenate two strings and display it.

v. WAP to add two objects of time class. Overload the operator ‘==’ to compare two objects

and display whether they are equal or not. Overload the assignment operator.

vi. WAP to add two objects of distance class. Overload the operator ‘>’ to compare two

objects and return the object with larger time value and display it. Overload the ‘==’

operator to compare and display whether two given objects contain same distance

value
